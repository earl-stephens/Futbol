## Introduction

This project is one I adapted from the Turing School of Software and Design's curriculum.  The project is written to be done in Ruby.  I took the project requirements and made it into a Java project.  The project requirements can be found at [Futbol](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/projects/futbol_pd/).  The three data files (in CSV format) were left unchanged.

## Getting Started   

The program does not have any output.  The main method is used to instantiate a StatTracker object.  Creating the test suite and the accompanying code are the objectives of the project, instead of displaying something to the user.  As a result, to get started, the user simply runs the test suite and checks for passing tests.

## Further Improvements

The project used a large amount of arrays, hashmaps and sets.  I would like to redo the project in an MVC framework, with the CSV data files imported into a database.  SQL could then be used to query the database for the data, instead of having to create all of the arrays and hashmaps.
